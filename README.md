 The agenda of this project was to write a Python code that reads in each abstract and extract the abstract identity (‘File’), 
 NSF organization (‘NSF org’), the award amount, and abstract text and output with a tabular format included.
 
 The second task performed is to Identify sentences in the abstract. The code output should contain the abstract identity, 
 the sentence number, and the sentence text delimited with a bar (|), and the total number of sentences per each file at the end
